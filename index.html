        <h1>speed skating</h1>
        <p class="description">
          is an ice sport in which the players wearing skates race on oval ice
          tracks. Speed skaters can attain a maximum speed of around 60km/h. The
          idea of the sport was originated in Scandinavia and Netherlands where
          the natives attached bones to their shoes and used it to travel on
          frozen rivers, lakes and canals.

            <h3>Short track</h3>
            <p class="rules">
              Races are run counter-clockwise on a 111-meter track. Short track
              races are almost always run in a mass start format in which two to
              six skaters may race at once. Skaters may be disqualified for
              false starts, impeding, and cutting inside the track. False starts
              occur when a skater moves before the gun goes off at the start of
              a race.
            </p>
            <p class="rules">
              Skaters are disqualified for impeding when one skater cuts in
              front of another skater and causes the first skater to stand up to
              avoid collision or fall. Cutting inside the track occurs when a
              skater's skates goes inside the blocks which mark the track on the
              ice. If disqualified the skater will be given last place in their
              heat or final.

            <h3>Long track</h3>
            <p class="rules">
              Races are run counter-clockwise on a 400-meter oval. In all
              individual competition forms, only two skaters are allowed to race
              at once. Skaters must change lanes every lap.
            </p>
            <p class="rules" >
              The skater changing from the outside lane to the inside has
              right-of-way. Skaters may be disqualified for false starts,
              impeding, and cutting inside the track. If a skater misses their
              race or falls they have the option to race their distance again.
              There are no heats or finals in long track, all rankings are by
              time.

            <h3>Team pursuit</h3>
            <p class="rules">
              The team pursuit is a team event in speed skating and is skated by
              teams of three skaters. Races resemble the team pursuit event in
              track cycling. Two teams race at a time, starting at a line in the
              middle of the straightaway. One team starts on each side of the
              track.
              </p>
              <p class="rules">
              There are several formats for the team pursuit. The Olympic format
              is unusual in that it is a cup format, with several rounds of
              exclusion between two teams. In the World Cup and World
              Championships, one race is skated and the teams are ranked by
              their finishing time.
